This section displays the code developed during the https://teamtreehouse.com/library/angularjs-3[Treehouse AngularJS course].
During that course an AngularJS application is developed. The application is a todo list manager.

NOTE: The initial AngularJS app is not connected to any backend. If you refreshed the browser, todo list chanages are lost.

`index.html` is the entry point to our AngularJS app.

[source,html]
./initial-angularjs/index.html
----
include::{sourceDir}/../initial-angularjs/index.html[indent=0]
----

We create the AngularJS application, in `app.js`

[source,javascript]
./initial-angularjs/scripts/app.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/../initial-angularjs/scripts/app.js[indent=0]
----

An AngularJS controller manages the application flow:

[source,javascript]
./initial-angularjs/scripts/controllers/main.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/../initial-angularjs/scripts/controllers/main.js[indent=0]
----

We have a `todos` directive. This directive uses the previous controller and the next template:

[source,javascript]
./initial-angularjs/scripts/directives/todos.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/../initial-angularjs/scripts/directives/todos.js[indent=0]
----

[source,javascript]
./initial-angularjs/templates/todos.html
----
include::{sourceDir}/../initial-angularjs/templates/todos.html[indent=0]
----

Our data service is currently loading todos from a mock json file.

[source,javascript]
./initial-angularjs/scripts/services/data.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/../initial-angularjs/scripts/services/data.js[indent=0]
----

[source,javascript]
./initial-angularjs/mock/todos.json
----
include::{sourceDir}/../initial-angularjs/mock/todos.json[indent=0]
